# Lab 21

Your goal in this lab is to write a very simple but functional class to manage the inventory and cost of one item in a store. Full instructions are online.

Github added a few new features for classes, so I'm testing a few on this lab. The autotesting should still work the same way as before from your perspective, but I might be able to give feedback in a slightly different way. We'll see. It seemed reasonable to test on a lab like this instead of a homework!
